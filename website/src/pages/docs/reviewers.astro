  <p>
    PR Review Kit runs a team of specialist AI agents, each focused on a different dimension of code
    quality. Every reviewer uses the same fresh PR-specific context collected before the review starts.
  </p>

  <h2 id="general">General Review</h2>
  <p>
    Covers overall code quality — the things every pull request should get right.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Logic correctness and edge case handling</li>
    <li>Naming conventions and readability</li>
    <li>DRY principles and code reuse</li>
    <li>Test coverage and quality</li>
    <li>Code best practices for the detected stack</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="security">Security Review</h2>
  <p>
    Checks security concerns relevant to your project — categories that don't apply to your stack are skipped, and stack-specific threats are added on top.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, XSS, etc.)</li>
    <li>Secret and credential exposure</li>
    <li>Authentication and session management</li>
    <li>Rate limiting and denial-of-service risks</li>
    <li>Insecure deserialization and broken access control</li>
    <li>Stack-specific and project-specific security threats</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="performance">Performance Review</h2>
  <p>
    Identifies efficiency problems relevant to your project — categories that don't apply to your stack are skipped, and stack-specific checks are added on top.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>N+1 query patterns</li>
    <li>Memory leak risks</li>
    <li>Missing or incorrect <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> usage</li>
    <li>Caching opportunities</li>
    <li>Unnecessary re-renders and expensive computations</li>
    <li>Stack-specific and project-specific performance patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="architecture">Architecture Review</h2>
  <p>
    Checks how the changes fit into the existing codebase structure — categories that don't apply to your architecture are skipped, and project-specific patterns are added on top.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>SOLID principles adherence</li>
    <li>Layer separation and boundary violations</li>
    <li>Coupling and cohesion analysis</li>
    <li>Consistency with existing patterns in the codebase</li>
    <li>Abstraction level appropriateness</li>
    <li>Stack-specific and project-specific architectural patterns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="business">Business Review</h2>
  <p>
    Runs last and translates technical findings into business language. This reviewer bridges the gap
    between engineering and product.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>User-facing impact of the changes</li>
    <li>Business risk and feature completeness</li>
    <li>GDPR and data safety implications</li>
    <li>Migration safety for database or API changes</li>
    <li>Deployment recommendations and post-ship monitoring checklist</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="improve">Code improvement</h2>
  <p>
    After reviews are complete, the Improve Code step generates concrete before/after code suggestions
    for the most important findings. Each suggestion shows the original code and the improved version
    side by side.
  </p>

  <h2 id="ask">Ask anything</h2>
  <p>
    The Ask Code step lets you ask any question about the specific changes in the PR. Use it to
    understand why a change was made, what the impact of a specific line is, or to explore alternative
    approaches.
